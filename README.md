# Image_Comparison_Tool
A simple visulization tool that visualize images with same name in different folders. 

I need to show some superior images in my paper. 
However, compare images one by one or open several windows at the same time is pretty troublesome.
So I wrote this tool that can check several folders at the same time, while switch image only need to press left or right button.
Hope this can help you write your paper.
Any suggestion or improvement is welcome.

Usage:  
1. Run `main.py`  
2. Set the number of folders in the menuscript (default 4, max 15)     
3. Load Image folders (**This first folder is considered as the main folder**)  
4. press '←' or '→' can move to previous or next image  
5. click one of the shown image can draw yellow point in all subfigure
